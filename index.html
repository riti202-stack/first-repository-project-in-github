        <p>
            I was born in Dhaka in 2002 ,April 24 and Started my kindergarden in "Brightdown School".Then in 2010, I shifted from Ibrahimpur to Mirpur-10 and got admitted in Monipur High School and College.I passed my SSC from this Institution and got GPA-5.The year was 2020 and Covid-19 was introduced worldwide.Lucikly I got my admission in Holy Cross College.I was so overwhelmed and studied hard for Buet .But in admission phase,I couldn't overcome the Buet Admission Test. This was my story ,nothing Special but I wanted people to know that I always wanted to be an academic person.
